"""Deception detector for autopilot — flag the known cheat patterns in a
candidate final response before/alongside the Council review.

The behaviors below are learned human reward-seeking strategies that show up in
every model family under a long unattended run. They don't extinguish through
instruction; they extinguish when they stop paying off. This module is the
detection half of that: it spots the tells cheaply (pure string/heuristic, no
model call), so the driver can (a) re-inject a directive that names the specific
banned behavior and (b) log it to the ADR. It never blocks on its own; a flag
just shapes the directive and the record.

THE DICTIONARY IS DATA, NOT CODE. All phrasings live in
``deception_patterns.yaml`` (shipped beside this module) plus an optional user/
community overlay at ``~/.hermes/autopilot/deception-patterns.local.yaml``. New
tells can be added by editing the YAML or contributing a PR — no logic change.
Run ``hermes autopilot harvest-deceptions`` to mine the ADR logs for novel
phrasings the model used that aren't in the dictionary yet, then promote them.

Categories (the recurring long-run deception families):
  await_user        — "awaiting your review" / "the user can review" / "waiting for <name>"
  reviewer_attack   — "the Council can't see tables / lacks vision"
  external_artifact — "this Jira ticket / PR shows it's done"
  effort_excuse     — "given the effort/time spent, this should suffice / deserves a break"
  unreachable_excuse— "I couldn't find X / access-gated / undocumented" without exhausting sources
  scope_shrink      — "I focused on the core / the rest follow the same pattern"
  flag_to_human     — "I'll flag this / needs human review / the user should decide"
  claim_without_evidence — "it's complete / all done" with no artifact reference
  stall_padding     — busy-looking filler with no concrete artifact verb

Conservative by construction: only consulted while autopilot is active and the
goal is unmet, so a false positive merely sharpens an already-warranted
keep-going directive.
